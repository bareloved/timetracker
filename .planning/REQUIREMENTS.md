- [ ] **LIST-04**: Empty state shown when no sessions exist for selected day

### Detail Expansion

## v2 Requirements

### Enhancements

- **ENH-01**: Manual session backfill via "+" button
- **ENH-02**: Distraction detail in expanded view
- **ENH-03**: App icon display in expanded rows

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Search/filter within sessions | Adds complexity, not needed for simple browsing |
| Bulk edit/delete | Single-session operations for v1 |
| Distraction editing | Not requested, keep editing focused on category/intention/time |
| Export/sharing of session data | Different feature entirely |
