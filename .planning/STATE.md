# Project State

## Project Reference

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Use `ScrollView + ForEach` instead of native `List` — avoids confirmed DisclosureGroup animation bounce on macOS
- Track expansion as `@State private var expandedSessionId: UUID?` — accordion pattern; one row at a time
- Sessions tab is additive — new `AppTab.sessions` case, minimal changes to `MainWindowView`
- [Phase 01]: AppUsage stores duration as TimeInterval; SessionEngine accumulates elapsed time between polls rather than counting polls
- [Phase 01]: CloudKit writes both appsUsedData (JSON) and appsUsed ([String]) for cross-client forward/backward compatibility
- [Phase 01]: ScrollView+ForEach over native List — confirmed avoids DisclosureGroup animation bounce on macOS 14
- [Phase 01]: UUID? expandedSessionId for accordion — single optional enforces one-at-a-time without Set overhead
- [Phase 02-edit-delete]: onDelete no-op on card — delete confirmation is inline card state, onConfirmDelete triggers actual deletion in parent
- [Phase 02-edit-delete]: Ported saveEditedSession and deleteSession verbatim from CalendarTabView for cross-tab consistency

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Verify whether `Session.appsUsed` carries per-app duration or only app names — row design may need to handle name-only gracefully
- Reset `expandedSessionId` to nil on `onChange(of: selectedDate)` — must be explicit, not automatic
