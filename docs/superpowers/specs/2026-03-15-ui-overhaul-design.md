# TimeTracker UI/UX Overhaul — Design Spec

Redesign the menu bar dropdown and add new features to make TimeTracker feel polished, data-rich, and delightful to use.

## Summary of Changes

Eight improvements to the existing app:

1. **Redesigned dropdown** — larger, data-rich panel with timeline, pulse chart, focus goal, progress bars
2. **Timeline view** — horizontal bar showing the day's sessions as colored blocks
3. **Live menu bar text** — show current timer + category in the menu bar (toggleable)
4. **Daily focus goal** — set a coding target, see progress ring
5. **App icons** — show actual app icons next to names in the dropdown
6. **Idle return popup** — ask what you were doing when you come back from being idle
7. **Global hotkey** — ⌥⇧T to pause/resume without opening the dropdown
8. **Weekly summary tab** — "This Week" tab showing totals across the week

## 1. Redesigned Dropdown

The dropdown grows from 260px to 360px wide. Layout top-to-bottom:

### Tab bar
- Two tabs: **Today** (default) and **This Week**
- Right-aligned hotkey hint: `⌥⇧T Pause`

### Today tab content

**Hero timer** — large centered timer showing `H:MM:SS` with live-updating seconds. Below it: green pulse dot + category name + app icons + app names.

**Focus goal card** — a horizontal card with a circular progress ring (percentage), goal label, and progress text (e.g. "3h 12m of 4h 30m coding target"). Only shown if a goal is configured.

**Timeline bar** — a single horizontal bar representing the day from first activity to now. Each session is a colored segment proportional to its duration. Time labels at start, middle, and end. Idle gaps shown as dim gray segments.

**Activity pulse** — a row of thin vertical bars, one per 15-minute slot of the day. Bar height = active time in that slot, color = dominant category. Gives a rhythm-of-the-day feel at a glance.

**Category breakdown** — list of categories sorted by duration. Each row: colored dot, category name, thin progress bar (proportional to total tracked time), and duration text. Replaces the plain text list.

### This Week tab content

Shows the same category breakdown but with totals aggregated from calendar events for the past 7 days. No timeline or pulse chart — just the category list with weekly totals and a total tracked time header.

### Bottom controls bar
- Left: pause/resume button, settings button (both icon-only)
- Right: hotkey hint `⌥⇧T`, separator, "Quit" text button

## 2. Timeline View

A horizontal bar chart rendered in the category breakdown area header.

- Spans from the first activity of the day to now
- Each session is a colored block proportional to its duration
- Idle gaps rendered as dim `#3a3a3c` blocks
- Time labels: start time, midpoint, and "Now"
- Tapping a segment does nothing (v1) — future: show session details

Data source: `SessionEngine.todaySessions` + `currentSession`.

Implementation: a custom SwiftUI `Shape` or `Canvas` view that renders rectangles proportional to session durations.

## 3. Live Menu Bar Text

The `MenuBarExtra` title changes from a static icon to a dynamic string.

When enabled: `⏱ 1:42 Coding` — icon + duration (H:MM) + category name.
When paused: `⏸ Paused`.
When disabled: just the clock icon (current behavior).

Controlled by a `@AppStorage("showMenuBarText")` boolean, toggled in settings. Default: enabled.

The title updates every 10 seconds via a timer (string assignment on `NSStatusItem` is cheap). The dropdown timer still updates every second.

Implementation: `MenuBarExtra` with `.window` style and a dynamic `label:` view has known rendering issues on macOS 14 — the label may not update reactively. **Fallback approach:** Use `NSStatusItem` directly instead of relying on `MenuBarExtra`'s label. Create the `NSStatusItem` in `AppState`, update its `button?.title` on the timer. The `MenuBarExtra` popover is still wired to the same status item. If `MenuBarExtra(content:label:)` works reliably in testing, prefer that; otherwise fall back to `NSStatusItem`.

## 4. Daily Focus Goal

A configurable daily target for a specific category.

Settings UI additions:
- **Goal category** picker (dropdown of existing categories)
- **Goal hours** stepper (0.5h increments, default: off/0)

Stored in `@AppStorage("goalCategory")` and `@AppStorage("goalHours")`.

In the dropdown, the focus goal card shows:
- Circular progress ring (0-100%, green when ≥100%)
- Category name and current/target text
- Only visible when goalHours > 0

Data source: sum of `todaySessions` durations for the goal category + current session if it matches.

## 5. App Icons

Show the actual app icon next to app names in the current session view.

`NSWorkspace.shared.icon(forFile:)` can get an app's icon from its bundle path. `NSRunningApplication.bundleURL` provides the path.

Store a mapping of `bundleId → NSImage` in the `ActivityMonitor` or a small `AppIconCache` service. Cache icons as they're discovered (apps don't change icons during a session).

In the UI, show 16x16 rounded icons inline with app names. Use `Image(nsImage:)` to bridge to SwiftUI.

`NSRunningApplication.bundleURL` can be `nil` for system processes. The cache falls back to `NSWorkspace.shared.icon(for: .applicationBundle)` (generic app icon) when the bundle URL is unavailable.

## 6. Idle Return Popup

When the user returns from idle (> 5 minutes), show a floating panel asking what they were doing.

**Trigger:** `ActivityMonitor` detects transition from idle → active. To distinguish idle-detected pauses from user-initiated pauses, `ActivityMonitor` tracks an `idleStartTime: Date?` that is set only when `IdleDetector.isIdle()` causes the pause (not when `pause()` is called manually). When the user returns from idle, the monitor calls `onIdleReturn?(idleDuration)` with the elapsed time, then clears `idleStartTime`. User-initiated pause/resume does not trigger this callback.

**Panel content:**
- "Welcome back!" header with idle duration
- Preset buttons: Meeting, Break, Away
- Custom text field option
- "Skip" link to leave as idle (no calendar event)

**Behavior:**
- If the user picks an option, create a calendar event for the idle period with that label
- If they skip, no event is created (gap stays empty in calendar)
- The panel is an `NSPanel` with `styleMask: [.nonactivatingPanel, .titled, .closable]`, `.level = .floating`, and `.collectionBehavior = [.canJoinAllSpaces, .fullScreenAuxiliary]` so it appears regardless of which Space or fullscreen app the user returns to

**Presets:** Stored in `@AppStorage` as a JSON array, editable in settings. Defaults: `["Meeting", "Break", "Away"]`.

## 7. Global Hotkey

Register `⌥⇧T` (Option+Shift+T) as a global keyboard shortcut to toggle pause/resume.

Implementation: `NSEvent.addGlobalMonitorForEvents` only *observes* key events — it cannot consume them, so the keystroke would leak to the frontmost app. Instead, use `CGEvent.tapCreate` to create an event tap that can intercept and consume the hotkey. This requires Accessibility permission, which the app already requests. The `HotkeyManager` creates a `CFMachPort` event tap for `.keyDown` events, checks for the ⌥⇧T combination, consumes the event, and calls `AppState.togglePause()`.

On trigger: show a brief `UNUserNotificationCenter` banner: "TimeTracker paused" / "TimeTracker resumed".

The hotkey is displayed in the dropdown's tab bar as a hint.

## 8. Weekly Summary

The "This Week" tab aggregates data from Apple Calendar.

Query `EKEventStore` for events in the "Time Tracker" calendar from Monday 00:00 to now. Group by event title (which is the category name), sum durations.

Display: same category breakdown layout as Today tab, but with weekly totals. Header shows total tracked time for the week.

Implementation: add an `async` method `weeklyStats() -> [String: TimeInterval]` to `CalendarWriter` that queries events on a background thread and returns category totals. The query covers Monday 00:00 through yesterday 23:59 — the current day's data comes from `SessionEngine.todaySessions` to avoid inconsistency between the in-memory and calendar data sources.

## Category Colors

Each category gets a consistent color. A static palette of 8 colors (Apple system colors):

```
Coding:        #5E5CE6 (indigo)
Email:         #FF9F0A (orange)
Communication: #30D158 (green)
Design:        #BF5AF2 (purple)
Writing:       #FF375F (pink)
Browsing:      #64D2FF (cyan)
Other:         #8E8E93 (gray)
(overflow):    #FFD60A (yellow)
```

Named categories get their assigned color. Unknown categories are assigned from an extended overflow palette of 4 additional colors: yellow, teal, brown, mint. Assignment is deterministic (hash of category name modulo overflow palette size). Two custom categories may share a color if there are more than 11 total categories — this is acceptable for a personal tool.

## Settings UI Layout

The settings window adds a **tab bar** at the top:
- **Categories** tab (existing functionality — sidebar + detail pane for category rules)
- **General** tab with:
  - **Menu Bar** section: "Show timer in menu bar" toggle
  - **Focus Goal** section: category picker + hours stepper (0.5h increments)
  - **Idle Return** section: editable list of preset labels (add/remove)

## Activity Pulse Details

The pulse chart shows slots from first activity of the day to now. Each slot is 15 minutes. Bar height = proportion of active time in that slot (full height = 15 min active, half = 7.5 min). Color = the category with the most time in that slot. Empty slots (before first activity or during long idle) are not shown.

## Animation Philosophy

Minimal, functional animations only:
- Tab switching: no animation (instant swap)
- Progress ring: animates on first appearance with a 0.5s ease-out fill
- Timeline and pulse: no entrance animation (render immediately)
- Idle return panel: standard macOS window appearance (no custom animation)

## Non-Goals

- No drag-to-rearrange in timeline
- No editing past sessions from the dropdown
- No notification sounds
- No cross-device sync
- No data export from the dropdown (calendar is the export)
